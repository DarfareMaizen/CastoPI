CastoPI
=======
Raspberry pi cast device
CastoPI (CastToPI)
  
I made this software to replace my chromecast. This will be coded in Bash and phyton. 

I use json-rpc for communication but protected with password 

This will run on OpenElec with XBMC 

Chrome extension like google cast but tab mirroring not available
